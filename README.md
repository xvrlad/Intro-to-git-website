# Intro-to-git-website
This is a website I made.

Also a practice of Git.

git status - displays current state of the directory.
git log - see commit history of repo

git add . or git add --all - add changes to the staging area, to be included in the next commit.
git commit -m "desc. of changes" - record your staged changes to commit history. (In local files)
git push - exports commits to remote branches on our GitHub account.

git checkout - undo changes
git reset -f - unstage changes

- Can right-click in file directory and open on either powershell or vsc (get to directory without cd)
